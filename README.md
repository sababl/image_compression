# **Image compression**

Image compression is a crucial technology in digital imaging, enabling efficient storage and transmission of images by reducing their file size without significantly compromising their quality. The essence of image compression lies in eliminating redundant and non-essential information within an image, thus minimizing the amount of data required to represent it. There are two primary types of image compression: lossless and lossy.

Lossless Compression methods allow for the exact original image to be reconstructed from the compressed data. Techniques such as Run-Length Encoding (RLE), Huffman Coding, and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression are commonly used. These methods are ideal for applications where preserving the original image data is critical, such as medical imaging and technical drawings.

Lossy Compression methods achieve higher compression ratios by discarding some of the image information, leading to a trade-off between image quality and file size. Techniques like JPEG compression, which uses the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), are widely used for photographic images where a certain degree of quality loss is acceptable for the benefit of significantly reduced file size.

Wavelet Transform in Image Compression: Wavelets have emerged as a powerful tool for image compression, offering several advantages over traditional methods like DCT. Wavelet-based compression, such as the JPEG 2000 standard, employs a mathematical function to divide the image into different frequency components, allowing for more precise control over how much detail is preserved or discarded in different parts of the image.

The key benefits of using wavelets for image compression include:

*Multi-Resolution Analysis*: Wavelets can represent an image at different levels of resolution, which is particularly useful for applications like progressive image transmission and scalable image storage.

*Superior Compression Ratios*: Wavelets can achieve higher compression ratios without significant loss of image quality, particularly for high-resolution images.

*Edge Preservation*: Wavelet transforms are more effective in preserving edges and fine details in images, leading to better visual quality after compression, especially in high-contrast areas.

*Flexibility*: Wavelet-based compression algorithms can be adapted to a wide range of compression needs and performance criteria, making them suitable for diverse applications, from web graphics to satellite imagery.


## **Wavelet Transform**

Wavelet transform is a mathematical technique used for analyzing signals and images. It decomposes a signal into different frequency components, allowing for a more detailed analysis of its time-frequency characteristics.

The wavelet transform uses a set of functions called wavelets, which are small, localized waveforms that can be scaled and translated to analyze different parts of a signal. These wavelets are typically chosen to have a finite duration, which makes them well-suited for analyzing signals with localized features.

The wavelet transform can be used for various applications, such as signal denoising, compression, feature extraction, and time-frequency analysis. It has found applications in fields like image processing, audio processing, and data analysis.

To perform the wavelet transform, the signal is convolved with the wavelet function at different scales and positions. This results in a set of coefficients that represent the contribution of each wavelet to the signal at different scales and positions. These coefficients can then be further analyzed or used for various applications.

The wavelet transform has several advantages over other signal analysis techniques, such as the Fourier transform. It provides a more localized representation of signals, allowing for better time-frequency analysis. It also allows for multi-resolution analysis, where different frequency components can be analyzed at different levels of detail.

In conclusion, the wavelet transform is a powerful tool for analyzing signals and images, providing a detailed time-frequency representation. It has numerous applications in various fields and is widely used in signal processing and data analysis.

### **Wavelets types :**

There are various types of wavelets, each with its unique properties and applications. Some of the most common types include:

**Haar Wavelet**: One of the oldest and simplest wavelets. It is piecewise constant and resembles a step function. It is useful for its computational simplicity and is used in introductory examples of wavelet analysis.

**Daubechies Wavelets**: Named after Ingrid Daubechies, these wavelets are a family of orthogonal wavelets defining a discrete wavelet transform and characterized by a maximal number of vanishing moments for some given support. They are widely used in signal processing.

**Coiflets**: Similar to Daubechies wavelets but designed to have both the wavelet and scaling functions be symmetric. They are often used in signal and image processing for their smoothness and symmetry properties.

**Symlets**: A modified version of Daubechies wavelets designed to be more symmetric. They are often used when a more symmetric wavelet function is required for analysis.

**Meyer Wavelets**: Based on the Fourier transform and are smooth and well localized in both frequency and time. They are used in applications requiring good frequency localization.

**Biorthogonal Wavelets**: These wavelets allow for more flexibility than orthogonal wavelets by relaxing the orthogonality condition. They are particularly useful in image compression (e.g., JPEG 2000 standard).

**Morlet Wavelets**: A complex wavelet used primarily in continuous wavelet transforms, particularly suited for analyzing localized time-frequency phenomena, especially in the field of seismic and geophysical research.

**Mexican Hat Wavelet**: Also known as the Ricker wavelet, it resembles a sombrero hat in shape. It is a continuous wavelet and is used in continuous wavelet transform applications, especially in edge detection in images.

**Gabor Wavelets**: Derived from Gabor filters, these wavelets are particularly useful in analyzing signals in the time-frequency domain, offering optimal resolution in both time and frequency. They are often used in texture analysis and signal detection.

Each of these wavelets has specific mathematical properties that make them suitable for different applications, such as signal processing, image compression, and pattern recognition. The choice of wavelet depends on the requirements of the application, including the need for smoothness, symmetry, compact support, orthogonality, and the ability to capture signal characteristics at different scales.
